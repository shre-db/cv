                <p>
                    I'm a young Mechanical Engineering graduate seeking an entry level or junior role in Deep Learning
                    or Data Science. I'm fond of Applied Math, Physics and Technology. During my degree and employment I
                    have worked on a number of projects where I applied "Reasoning from first principles" to successfully
                    solve engineering problems that required analytical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, cognitive
                    flexibility and resourcefulness.

                    initially load due to the free tier resources I am currently using. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and kindly ask for your
                    patience as the website loads.

                           This end-to-end machine learning project is focused on analyzing coal usage in the United States from 2001 to 2021 and
                            classifying coal using data gathered from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
                            through their API. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Geospatial Analysis,
                            Chemometrics and coal production Time Series Analysis (only Trend). Custom Transformers were built
                            for Feature Engineering. Transformation pipelines were implemented for convenient preprocessing of data.
                            Machine Learning algorithms like Softmax Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Feed Forward
                            Network were implemented and cross-validation was used to evaluate their performance.
                            Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve the performance of Feed Forward Network.
                            The Random Forest classification model was deployed using Flask on Render Cloud Hosting.

                           The project focuses on developing an FFN (Feed-Forward Network) model with a unique feature
                            of "Artificial Curiosity". Artificial Curiosity in the context of this project is a process
                            that involves applying affine transformations to input test data and using a model trained
                            on regular; non-transformed data to predict on the transformed data. The model then filters
                            the predictions based on the least entropy for log-softmax values, specifically softmax
                            values. The choice of the word "curiosity" to describe the process of applying different
                            transformations to test images makes sense, as it reflects the idea of exploring different
                            possibilities to make a prediction. The model is "curiosity-driven" in the sense that it
                            explores different possibilities of orientations and mirroring of the test image in order
                            to make a prediction, rather than relying solely on what it was trained on. This
                            demonstrates some level of creativity in the sense that the model is able to find new ways
                            of solving the problem of image recognition, rather than just being limited to what it was
                            trained on. While the number and types of transformations used in this project are limited
                            for demonstration purposes, the concept of artificial curiosity can be extended to include a
                            range of creative transformations. This project uses a feed-forward neural network (FFN)
                            because FFNs lack spatial perception and are unable to recognize images that do not resemble
                            the training data. This weakness of FFNs is exploited to demonstrate the concept of
                            artificial curiosity. When the model is predicting with 'curious' mode, it can recognize
                            manipulated images, while in 'standard' mode, it cannot. This distinction provides a clear
                            demonstration of the advantages and limitations of the two modes.

                            'Accuracy score' was used to calculate 'Versatility score', therefore in the experiment
                            Versatility score is defined as the difference between accuracy of curious and non-curious
                            modes of the model. In standard mode the model achieved an average accuracy of 0.25 while
                            the curious mode achieved an average accuracy of 0.61. This resulted in a Versatility score
                            of 0.36, this implies with the help of artificial curiosity the model had an improvement of
                            36% compared to its standard classification ability, which is quite interesting. The null
                            hypothesis was rejected owing to the p-value being 9.50e-113 which is well below the common
                            significance level of 0.05. The negative t-statistic value of -133.77 obtained in the test
                            indicated that the curious mode (second group) had a significantly higher mean accuracy than

                           This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch
                            to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia. The CNN architecture comprises
                            6 convolution and max pooling layers, each with batch normalization and dropout regularization
                            at 25% probability to prevent overfitting. Additionally, there are 6 fully connected layers,
                            also with dropout regularization at 50% probability. The model has a little over 17 million
                            trainable parameters. The dataset is imbalanced, with the normal class comprising 1349 images
                            and the pneumonia class comprising 3883 images. To address this, a weighted BCEWithLogitsLoss
                            loss function was experimented with `pos_weight` parameter and single unit output layer,
                            but the model performed poorly perhaps due to an unidentified systematic error. Provisionally,
                            an alternative architecture involving two unit output layer and a weighted CrossEntropyLoss
                            loss function using `weight` parameter is employed. The model was trained with the help of
                            DataLoaders in batches of 32 images, and the Adam optimizer. The primary performance metric
                            used was accuracy. After training for 10 epochs on Colab's GPU accelerated environment, the
                            model achieved a training accuracy of 96.61% and a test accuracy of 87.17%. It was observed
                            that the model performed significantly better on the training set compared to the test set,
                            indicating overfitting and that a change in model architecture and hyperparameter tuning may
                            be necessary. Currently, the model is under development.

                           The project involves using Transfer Learning with ResNet-18 and VGG-16 pre-trained models.
                            The pre-trained models were first frozen to prevent any changes in their weights during training.
                            Then, the final layers of these models were modified to output 10 categories. The retrained
                            ResNet-18 and VGG-16 models were then used to classify the STL10 dataset from the torchvision
                            library. The dataset was split into training and test sets, and the models were retrained on
                            the training set. The retrained models were evaluated on the test data. While both models
                            performed well, the VGG-16 outperformed the ResNet-18 in classifying images of STL10 dataset.

                            Hydraulic pump is a device which converts mechanical power into hydraulic
                            energy. Pumps incorporated with active valves provide active control on both the
                            inlet and outlet valves. Since controlled actuation is required, piezoelectric
                            actuators are used as the actuation system. Piezo-actuators can produce higher
                            force and can be operated at higher actuation frequencies.
                            In this work active valves are designed for a high pressure piezo-hydraulic pump.
                            Valve Sealing Plates for piezoelectric actuators are designed for the valve
                            actuation. The Valve Sealing Plate is analysed using ANSYS analysis software.
                            Suitable mathematical model is developed for valve actuator using MATLAB
                            software. An alternate design for active valve actuation using Rotary Valve
                            Actuator is proposed and analysed. MATLAB Simulink is used to develop the
                            mathematical model which synchronizes the motions of pumping actuator and
                            rotary valve. Also, simulations are carried out for the determination of pumped
                            volume and flow rate of a particular cylinder.

                            In this work, design of a ‘Valve Sealing Plate’ incorporated with active valves was
                            carried out. Two designs were developed, out of which one of the designs was
                            fabricated due to the machining limitations in the other design. The analysis of both
                            the designs have been carried out using Ansys. Mathematical modelling was
                            carried out for the valve actuator with the valve sealing plate and the displacement
                            of the piezo actuator achieved was 289.89 microns. The valve sealing plate was
                            fabricated using spring steel.
                            Another design is ‘Rotary Valve Actuator’. In this work, design of ‘Rotary Valve
                            Actuator’ was done and multiple variants were explored. A stepper motor would be
                            driving an internal cylinder with a slot on its lateral surface area. Mathematical
                            modelling was done to synchronize the motion of the pumping actuator with that of
                            the stepper motor.

                            The project aims to explore the feasibility of a frictionless braking system using the principle

                            An equation was derived which described angular acceleration of two point masses revolving
                            around a point with strings providing the necessary centripetal force. This equation showed
                            that angular deceleration of the rotating system is directly proportional to the radial velocity
                            of the masses. This abstract idea and proof was then applied to an approximately real world
                            system by replacing the point masses with high density fluid flowing radially outwards in
                            four cylindrical tubes. The resulting expression describes the resisting torque acting on the
                            system as a result of fluid flow in the tubes.

                            The focus of this project is to demonstrate a prototype and propose a design of a mechanical
                            system that rectifies direction of rotation. It is analogous to a full-wave electrical rectifier
                            and therefore the name 'Mechanical Rectifier Mechanism'. This mechanical system is the result of
                            an advanced application of modified bevel gears. The mechanism converts input rotation of any direction
                            (clockwise or counterclockwise) to one desired direction of output rotation depending on the design. By its nature it
                            also effectively locks the gear train for one input direction of rotation and facilitates
                            freewheeling in the other direction thereby completely cutting off power transmission when used
                            in reverse irrespective of the direction of rotation. Another important characteristic of this design
                            is the continuous uninterrupted transmission of mechanical power from input to output even when the
                            input rotation is bidirectional. This system was theorized to enable functioning of another
                            complex yet compact automobile transmission named 'Concentric Gears Transmission'. However, the
                            feasibility study of this transmission was discontinued later.

                            The focus of this project is to demonstrate a prototype of a electronic drawing tool that
                            integrates the functionality of compass, divider and protractor. The selling point of this
                            device is the fact that it doesn't require a ruler for setting radius rather it is achieved
                            using electronics. A 10k ohm linear potentiometer is used for pivoting arms of the device. An
                            Arduino Nano microcontroller board is used for under the hood computation. An OLED 0.96"
                            display is used for displaying radius and angular measurements, all of which are powered by two
                            3V button cells in series. The device is engineered to convert analog voltage resulting from
                            mechanical rotation of the arms into a digital signal using Arduino's ADC and then calibrated
                            based on the design of the potentiometer to compute rotation in degrees. Once the rotational
                            information is processed, the distance between the tips of the arms is calculated using cosine
                            rule.

                            The focus of this project is to demonstrate a prototype of an electronic device that can measure
                            distance between "two" distant objects in front of it. Consider a triangular setup ABC, where point
                            C is the location of the device, points A and B are the locations of target objects. A basic
                            version of this device is primarily designed to compute the distance 'AB'. The device consists of two
                            ultrasonic distance measuring sensors fitted on its two arms, a 10k ohm potentiometer, an arduino microcontroller,
                            an OLED 0.96" display and a battery. The two arms of this hand held device are directed to
                            the two targets in front of it and a button is pressed. The two ultrasound sensors measure
                            the distances CA and CB, the potentiometer measures the angle between the two arms simultaneously.
                            This information is then used by the microcontroller to compute the distance AB using Trigonometry.
                            An advanced version of this device which is out of the scope of this project, integrated with
                            servo motors to control the movement of arms and real time video processing can provide
                            information like relative velocity and relative acceleration of the targets by computing
                            first and second time derivatives of displacement signal streams from electromagnetic radiation
                            based distance sensors. This kind of systems may find potential applications in advanced weapon
                            systems and space rovers.

                            This is a conceptual design project aimed at demonstrating a design of a spanner that uses a form of
                            'mechanical rectifier mechanism' as described in one of the other projects to increase
                            operational efficiency. The spanner design proposed here is different from conventional spanners
                            in the sense that it uses two ratchet-pawl mechanism to increasing efficiency by operating in
                            opposite direction as well. With a non-ratcheted spanner one has to detach it from a work-piece
                            at the end of every half cycle, return to an approximately original angular position, attach
                            the spanner to the work piece and fasten again. This is the end of one cycle. Single ratcheted
                            spanner solves the problem of 'detaching' by introducing freewheeling in one of the directions
                            using a ratchet-pawl mechanism. However, in the direction of freewheeling there is no transmission
                            of torque to the 'jaws' and ultimately to the work piece. On an introduction of another ratchet-pawl
                            mechanism, torque transmission could be done in both directions in a cycle. The spanner design has
                            two shafts, one to hold and another to rotate. Rectification of rotational motion is achieved
                            using a number of internal and external spur gears having intrinsic ratchet-pawl mechanism.

                            The centrifugal declutching mechanism is a design project aimed at creating a mechanism that
                            works in the opposite way of a centrifugal clutch. The mechanism automatically declutches two
                            power transmitting units as it approaches a certain angular velocity. The system consists of
                            six main components, including a frame, mass, rope, pulley, spring, and friction plate. The
                            springs default the clutch's state to 'engaged' when the system is stationary. The 'masses'
                            by design have greater inertial mass than friction plates and other displacing components
                            of the system under the action of centrifugal force. As the system's rotational speed
                            increases, the centrifugal force kicks in and the friction plates lean inwards as a result of
                            greater centrifugal force acting on 'Masses' (blue). A mathematical derivation was
                            penned down to arrive at an equation that explains the amount of mass required to keep the
                            system in equilibrium.
